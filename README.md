# WhatsApp-Export-Parser

Python Script to turn WhatsApp Chat Export file (via email) to a Pandas DataFrame for further processing. By default, it will turn the exported chat into a .html file.

To use this script, please put this script (or at least the script working directory) in the same folder with the WhatsApp Export Result. Put the script in the same folder with the exported files, .txt, and images.

Keep in mind that each WhatsApp .txt message export has a different datetime type, depending on the user configurence and preference. This script has been tested to work with DD\MM\YYY format.
